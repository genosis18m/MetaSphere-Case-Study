# MetaSphere-Case-Study
## **Background**

A startup called MetaSphere has created a virtual world where users can work, socialize, and play. The platform offers VR-based experiences, including virtual offices, gaming zones, and interactive social spaces. Despite having an innovative product, user engagement is lower than expected, and the retention rate is declining.

## **Problem Statement**

MetaSphere’s analytics show that:

1. New users spend an average of 30 minutes on the platform before logging out.

2. Only 20% of new users return after the first week.

3. The most active users are gamers, while the professional and social segments are struggling.

The company needs to improve engagement and retention while balancing the needs of different user segments.

## **Discussion Questions (to be answered in PPT)**

1. What factors could be causing low retention and engagement?

2. How can MetaSphere enhance user experience to increase time spent on the platform?

3. Should the company focus more on gaming or invest in improving virtual work/social spaces?

4. What technological or design changes could make the metaverse more immersive and engaging?
